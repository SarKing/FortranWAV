# FortranWAV
Basic Fortran module for reading .WAV file samples and metadata.


There is no error handling and it (natively) only works with 2-channel 16-bit .WAV files. 
This is one of my first attempts at coding with Fortran, so don't expect much.

There is a example in the demo/ folder. Tested with gfortran 10.2.1-6
